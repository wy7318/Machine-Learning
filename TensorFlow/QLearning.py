'''Reinforcement Learning

1) Environment : This is what our agent will explore. i.e. Level of the game, Or maze
2) Agent : Entiry that's exploring the environment. i.e. Mario is agent in Mario game
3) State : Where you are in the environment. i.e. position of agent is at in the environment
4) Action : i.e. Moving to the left or right no did nothing
5) Reward : What agent is trying to maximize
Goal is, 'Agent' explore the 'Environment' and go through some 'States' by 'Action' to achieve maximum 'Reward'

Q-Learning : Creating table of 'Actions' and 'States', predicting the rewards of each state by the action
