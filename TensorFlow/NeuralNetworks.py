'''Neural Networks
Densely Connected Neural Network
Every node in different layers(input, hidden, output) is connected to each other.

Connection : weight
Bias : Some constant numeric value that's connected to the next layer. When bias is connected to another layer, weight is typically 1.

layer's node value = [sum of (Previous connected Node Value)*(weight)] + (Bias value)*(Weight =1)
